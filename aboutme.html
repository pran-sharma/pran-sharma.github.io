      <h2>Milestones of My Life</h2>
      <h3>My First Dream Job</h3>
      <p>
        The first job I can remember ever wanting was to be an 
        inventor when I was just beginning school.
      </p>
      <h3>Intro to Robotics</h3>
      <p>
        By middle school, I had a posse of little nerds like me, 
        participating in math competitions and all. Some of my 
        pals had the idea to join a Lego robotics league, so we 
        teamed up and started competing. I loved the creative 
        problem solving involved, and began down a long, fun path.
      </p>
      <h3>Choosing Computers</h3>
      <p>
        In high school, I joined the school's budding robotics 
        and programming teams, finding fulfillment from learning 
        new skills, solving interesting problems, developing strong 
        relationships with my teammates, and taking on leadership 
        responsibilities. Robotics introduced me to new technical skills,
        including CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting, even machining, 
        massively widening my repertoire from the simple power 
        tools my dad let me use growing up, but both teams improved 
        my coding ability. I decided with my strengths, along with 
        my personal interests and hobbies like graphic design and 
        gaming, that a career in computers would be ideal.
      </p>
      <h3>Honing My Skills</h3>
      <p>
        college, robotics (minor!), programming, 3d printing
      </p>
      <h3>Entering the Workforce</h3>
      <p>
        doing cool projects at lockheed, developed two internal apps from scratch, continued dev of another in progress, all using different languages
      </p>
      <h3>Cross-Country Creative Renaissance</h3>
      <p>
        starting full time at microsoft, stuck at home when covid hit, many project ideas, mainly creative, finding my true passions

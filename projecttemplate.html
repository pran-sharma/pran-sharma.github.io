      <h2>Controller Configurator Design Study</h2>
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Windows gaming is a massive, ever-expanding space, yet 
        native support for controller configuration and 
        calibration is extremely limited. This project's goal 
        is to allow one to customize the functionality of their 
        controllers through the Windows settings. Desirable, 
        accessible features can be seen in Valve's Steam 
        Controller or Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller 
        but require additional software to configure.
      </p>
      <p class="caption">
        The image below on the left is the existing application 
        to calibrate controllers, which is ugly, outdated, and 
        even hard to find. The image on the right is the prototype 
        settings controller configurator concept.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="..\images\controller\joycpl.png" alt="legacy controller calibration settings"></td>
          <td><img src="..\images\controller\configconcept.png" alt="Windows settings controller configurator concept"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p class="caption">
        The left image below is the prototype settings joystick 
        range/dead zone configuration concept. The image on 
        the right shows similar functionality in the Xbox 
        Accessories app, which can configure the Xbox Elite 
        Controller as well as the Xbox Adaptive Controller.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="..\images\controller\deadzoneconfig.png" alt="controller configurator joystick deadzone calibration concept"></td>
          <td><img src="..\images\controller\deadzonexbox.png" alt="Xbox Accessories App trigger deadzone calibration"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Potential Features</h3>
      <p>
        Customizing joystick dead zones and remapping buttons 
        is only the beginning of the features I envision for the 
        configurator. Joysticks and triggers could have adjustable 
        acceleration curves, and to accommodate inputs of any kind, 
        custom controllers could be configured with inputs from 
        trackballs, touch pads, dials, and sliders to even 
        microphones, all with configurable behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="caption">
        The Xbox Accessories app allows configurability of joystick 
        sensitivity curves.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="standaloneImg" src="..\images\controller\sensitivityxbox.png" alt="Xbox Accessories App joystick sensitivity calibration"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        In addition, users could remap inputs to output muti-key 
        macros or multiple input combinations to output alternate 
        behavior, or even swap between different configuration 
        profiles to allow more functionality from the same limited 
        inputs on a controller. Outputs may also be mapped to 
        other accessibility-improving functionality, such as a 
        controller-compatible on-screen keyboard or speech-to-text 
        dictation. These features could even boost productivity 
        in professional applications, where a user may desire 
        more shortcuts to enrich and speed up their workflow.
      </p>

        The Steam Controller's on-screen keyboard allows one to type 
        very effectively with a controller with only two fingers. 
        Predictive text options allow for even quicker typing.

        <tr>
          <td><img class="standaloneImg" src="..\images\controller\keyboardsteam.png" alt="Steam Controller on-screen keyboard"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>
        This feature may not only have implications for gaming, 
        but also for greater accessibility in everyday OS operation. 
        Mouse and keyboard use may pose challenges to the differently 
        abled, so a controller, especially a custom one, could be an 
        easier to use, fully functioned primary input device. One 
        might even configure secondary, tertiary, or even more 
        additional input devices to further enhance the efficiency
        and versatility of their Windows use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handheld gaming devices such as Valve's Steam Deck may also 
        benefit from a Windows controller configurator. Running 
        Windows on such a device would allow wider game compatibility, 
        as well as enable full-fledged computer functionality and 
        synchronicity with other Windows devices.
      </p>
      <p class="caption">
        Enabling controllers to be used as primary inputs has great 
        implications for accessibility, including the Xbox Adaptive 
        Controller for near infinite customizability, as well as for 
        Windows on handheld devices, such as the Steam deck.

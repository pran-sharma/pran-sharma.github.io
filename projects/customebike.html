    <h2>Custom Electric Bicycle</h2>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
      After moving to Seattle and losing my car on the way 
      (see video), I obviously found it more difficult to get 
      around. I had to rely on public transportation and my 
      own two feet, and felt myself longing for an easier, 
      more independent mode of travel around the city and 
      beyond, potentially even to commute to and from work. 
      Due to the high cost to my bank account and the 
      environment, replacing my car was out of the question. 
      I instead considered personal electric vehicles such 
      as motorized scooters, skateboards, and bicycles, and 
      figured a bike would best fit my critera, weighting 
      range heaviest in my decision. Looking into different 
      ebikes, I discovered that options within my budget, 
      while meeting my range requirements, did not fit my 
      aesthetic appeal whatsoever. As an avid DIYer, I 
      thought it could be a fun, fulfilling project to build 
      my own ebike, and I could make it look however I'd 
      like and exactly meet my power and range requirements, 
      while also being easily upgraded if necessary.

    <h3>building it</h3>

      Users could remap inputs to output muti-key 
      macros or multiple input combinations to output alternate 
      behavior, or even swap between different configuration 
      profiles to allow more functionality from the same limited 
      inputs on a controller. Outputs may also be mapped to 
      other accessibility-improving functionality, such as a 
      controller-compatible on-screen keyboard or speech-to-text 
      dictation. These features could even boost productivity 
      in professional applications, where a user may desire 
      more shortcuts to enrich and speed up their workflow.

      The Steam Controller's on-screen keyboard allows one to 
      type very effectively with a controller, with two cursors 
      controlled by the left and right joystick and activated 
      by the left and right trigger. Predictive text options 
      allow for even quicker typing.

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
      Handheld gaming devices such as Valve's Steam Deck may also 
      benefit from a Windows controller configurator. More 
      widespread game compatibility would be supported by running 
      Windows on such devices, and full-fledged computer use could 
      be enabled as well.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      Enabling controllers to be used as primary inputs has great 
      implications for accessibility, including the Xbox Adaptive 
      Controller for near infinite customizability, as well as for 
      Windows on handheld devices, such as the Steam deck.

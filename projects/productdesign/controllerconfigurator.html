<h3>Controller Configurator Design</h3>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
  Windows gaming is a massive, ever-expanding space, yet 
  native support for controller configuration and 
  calibration is extremely limited. This project's goal 
  is to allow one to customize the functionality of their 
  controllers through the Windows settings. Desirable, 
  accessible features can be seen in Valve's Steam 
  Controller or Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller 
  but require additional software to configure.

  to calibrate controllers, which is ugly, outdated, and 
  even hard to find. The image on the right is the prototype 
  settings controller configurator concept.

<h4>Potential Features</h4>
<p>
  Customizing joystick dead zones and remapping buttons 
  is only the beginning of the features I envision for the 
  configurator. Joysticks and triggers could have adjustable 
  acceleration curves, and to accommodate inputs of any kind, 
  custom controllers could be configured with inputs from 
  trackballs, touch pads, dials, and sliders to even 
  microphones, all with configurable behavior.

  The Xbox Accessories app allows configurability of joystick 
  sensitivity curves.

<p>
  In addition, users could remap inputs to output muti-key 
  macros or multiple input combinations to output alternate 
  behavior, or even swap between different configuration 
  profiles to allow more functionality from the same limited 
  inputs on a controller. Outputs may also be mapped to 
  other accessibility-improving functionality, such as a 
  controller-compatible on-screen keyboard or speech-to-text 
  dictation. These features could even boost productivity 
  in professional applications, where a user may desire 
  more shortcuts to enrich and speed up their workflow.

  The Steam Controller's on-screen keyboard allows one to type 
  very effectively with a controller with only two fingers. 
  Predictive text options allow for even quicker typing.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>
  This feature may not only have implications for gaming, 
  but also for greater accessibility in everyday OS operation. 
  Mouse and keyboard use may pose challenges to the differently 
  abled, so a controller, especially a custom one, could be an 
  easier to use, fully functioned primary input device. One 
  might even configure secondary, tertiary, or even more 
  additional input devices to further enhance the efficiency
  and versatility of their Windows use.
</p>
<p class="caption">
  Enabling controllers to be used as primary inputs has great 
  implications for accessibility, including the Xbox Adaptive 
  Controller for near infinite customizability, as well as for 
  Windows on handheld devices, such as the Steam deck.

<p>
  Handheld gaming devices such as Valve's Steam Deck may also 
  benefit from a Windows controller configurator. Running 
  Windows on such a device would allow wider game compatibility, 
  as well as enable full-fledged computer functionality and 
  synchronicity with other Windows devices.

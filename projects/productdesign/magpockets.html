<h4>Status: Product Testing</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    A removable pocket would be a fun new way to accessorize, especially for men, 
    who often shy away from more flashy accessories like jewelry or bags, as well 
    as a practical storage space for women, whose pants pockets are generally 
    anemic if not nonexistent.

<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    I began by ideating how I might create a comfortable, robust, nondestructive 
    method of fastening a pocket to another fabric.

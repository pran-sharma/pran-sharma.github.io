<h2>Custom Electric Bicycle</h2>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>
  After moving to Seattle and losing my car on the way 
  (see video), I obviously found it more difficult to get 
  around. I had to rely on public transportation and my 
  own two feet, and felt myself longing for an easier, 
  more independent mode of travel around the city and 
  beyond, potentially even to commute to and from work. 
  Due to the high cost to my bank account and the 
  environment, replacing my car was out of the question. 
  I instead considered personal electric vehicles such 
  as motorized scooters, skateboards, and bicycles, and 
  figured a bike would best fit my critera, weighting 
  range heaviest in my decision. Looking into different 
  ebikes, I discovered that options within my budget, 
  while meeting my range requirements, did not fit my 
  aesthetic appeal whatsoever. As an avid DIYer, I 
  thought it could be a fun, fulfilling project to build 
  my own ebike, and I could make it look however I'd 
  like and exactly meet my power and range requirements, 
  while also being easily upgraded if necessary.

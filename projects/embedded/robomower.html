<h3>Autonomous Robotic Lawn Mower</h3>
<h4>Prelude</h4>
<p>
    My senior year of undergraduate study quickly came around in my third year of 
    college, and with that came my senior design capstone project. 
    Despite having a fair bit of practical experience with robotics, from
    LEGO to metal, from friendly competition to national defense, I hadn't quite 
    figured out what goals most motivated me, and without a clear 
    destination in mind, the path to take was even less clear. Therefore, rather 
    than taking matters into my own hands, I decided to listen to pitches and try 
    to judge which projects most piqued my interest. A few computer vision projects 
    were very intriguing, including monitoring analog gauges and representing their 
    values digitally, and extracting characters, especially those difficult to read, 
    from historic tombstones. However, I was most compelled by Duke Energy's pitch 
    to automate their solar field's lawn maintenance with the power of robotics.

<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    We were tasked to devise an <strong>efficient and precise</strong> 
    method of <strong>autonomously cutting grass</strong> in 
    a 500 square foot area within 
    a <strong>field of solar panels</strong> with a robot no larger 
    than two feet long in any dimension.

<h3>3D Holographic Display</h3>
<h4>Status: Work in Progress</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    The illusion of a 3D image floating in space could 
    be created by our eyes' <strong>persistence of vision</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, I wanted to <strong>spin a 2D RGB LED matrix</strong> quickly around its 
    center. If its speed of rotation were measured, every point each LED sweeps 
    through could be a distinct "pixel" assigned a different RGB value creating 
    a cylindrical display.
</p>
<p>
    The cylindrical display's polar resolution would depend on how slowly the LED 
    matrix could spin while still showing a cohesive image and how quickly each 
    LED could be updated. Making the display with a higher resolution or simply 
    larger seems trivial, so I decided to create a <strong>small proof of concept</strong>.
</p>
<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    An early obstacle I encountered was <strong>twisting wires</strong>, which could simply 
    be avoided by using a mounted battery. The extra bulk to spin and need to charge the 
    device, however, killed that idea. A <strong>slip ring</strong> would also quite simply solve 
    the issue, allowing wires to enter one side stationarily and leave the other 
    side completely <strong>unconstrained to spin without tangling</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    I decided to make my life harder and <strong>consolidate</strong> the spinning LED mount, motor 
    mount, and slip ring into one sleek, compact design. The most difficult part 
    turned out being the slip ring, but it eventually came together in an <strong>ugly, yet 
    functional</strong> package.  However, upon adding the motor to my testing, I found the 
    slip ring I designed, while properly conducting electricity, had far more 
    rotational friction than my feeble motor could handle and was <strong>far less 
    functional than it needed to be</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
    Falling back to a tried and true engineering principle - <strong>keeping it simple</strong> - 
    turned out to be my saving grace. Purchasing a properly engineered slip ring 
    made the spinning platform and motor mount the (<strong>much easier</strong>) core problems 
    to solve instead. Decoupling the motor from the LED platform had another 
    beneficial side effect of allowing the dinky motor to be <strong>geared to impart 
    more torque</strong>, which it sorely needed.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, any image or animation with infinite polar symmetry, like a ball, could be 
    displayed, but the "display" is not yet fully functional. It needs to 
    <strong>measure its rotational velocity</strong> in order to display the proper frame at each 
    position of rotation. This measurement is also necessary for the display to 
    have distinct, static sides without spinning the image or 
    animation unintentionally.
</p>
<p>
    To determine the rate of rotation, the time elapsed during a single spin must 
    be measured. Common ways to do so include using a reflected light sensor or a 
    hall effect sensor. I chose to use a hall effect sensor because it was the only 
    method I thought of when purchasing components, though in hindsight, the spinning 
    electronics and wires may induce magnetic fields and cause issues with the readings. 
    Fingers crossed!

<p>
    Time for some math and programming!

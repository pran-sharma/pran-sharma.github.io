<h3>SmartLock/OpenLock/ModLock</h3>
<h4>Status: Work in Progress</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    A bolt-on smart lock that could be as *smart or dumb* as you need would be a 
    great *quality of life* improvement for myself and most people.
</p>
<p>
    At every apartment I've ever lived in, I wished my door's lock could do more- 
    from unlocking/locking remotely/automatically to monitoring the outside world. 
    Sure, video doorbells and smart locks are on the market, but they're not very 
    renter-friendly, they all require different apps, they're not entirely 
    configurable, and being closed source they could compromise your security.

<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    As my first endeavor into the world of the internet of things, I began with a 
    simple exercise to allow my microcontroller to connect to my network and host 
    a web portal I may use to control, configure, and monitor my lock. The 
    microcontroller first broadcasts a network which hosts a web portal where a 
    user may scan for and join their own network. Once connected, it then hosts the 
    lock's command center.

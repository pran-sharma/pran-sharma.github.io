<h3>Light Painting Robot Arm</h3>
<h4>Status: Work in Progress</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    A <strong>robot arm</strong> with a light on its end could be controlled to 
    draw precise paths and create beautiful and colorful <strong>long exposure</strong> 
    images with a technique commonly referred to as <strong>light painting</strong>.

    I 3D printed a freely available robot arm model so I could 
    primarily focus on programming its movement.

<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    I wanted to make <strong>software development</strong> the priority of this 
    project, so instead of designing my own robot arm, I ordered some 
    cheap servo motors and found a <strong>fully 3D-printable model</strong> 
    so I wouldn't need to get extra hardware to add even 
    more project parts to my already cluttered small apartment. 
    I <strong>3D printed</strong> the robot's parts piece by piece, finding parts 
    I needed to improve or change. Obviously, a way to mount the RGB LED strip at the 
    arm's end was necessary. Once I iterated my way to a working 3-DOF robot arm, 
    I set to programming.

    The first two designs I had the robot make were a cute smiley face and 
    a "hire me" sign to try to promote my LinkedIn.

    To direct the motion of the robot arm, I'd have to build up its capabilities to make it 
    progressively easier to control. I first figured out how to smoothly move the servos 
    to any given angle, then calculated the angles the elbow and shoulder servos should 
    move to in order to move to any (x,y) coordinate with its origin at the shoulder.

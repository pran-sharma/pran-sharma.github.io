    <h2>Controller Configurator Design Study</h2>
    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Windows gaming is a massive, ever-expanding space, yet 
      native support for controller configuration and 
      calibration is extremely limited. This project's goal 
      is to allow one to customize the functionality of their 
      controllers through the Windows settings. Desirable, 
      accessible features can be seen in Valve's Steam 
      Controller or Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller 
      but require additional software to configure.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      The image below on the left is the existing application 
      to calibrate controllers, which is ugly, outdated, and 
      even hard to find. The image on the right is the prototype 
      settings controller configurator concept.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="..\images\controller\joycpl.png" alt="legacy controller calibration settings"></td>

      The left image below is the prototype settings joystick 
      range/dead zone configuration concept. The image on 
      the right shows similar functionality in the Xbox 
      Accessories app, which can configure the Xbox Elite 
      Controller as well as the Xbox Adaptive Controller.

      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Potential Features</h3>
    <p>
      Customizing joystick dead zones and remapping buttons 
      is only the beginning of the features I envision for the 
      configurator. Joysticks and triggers could have adjustable 
      acceleration curves, and to accommodate inputs of any kind, 
      custom controllers could be configured with inputs from 
      trackballs, touch pads, dials, and sliders to even 
      microphones, all with configurable behavior.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      The Xbox Accessories app allows configurability of joystick 
      sensitivity curves.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img class="standaloneImg" src="..\images\controller\sensitivityxbox.png" alt="Xbox Accessories App joystick sensitivity calibration"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In addition, users could remap inputs to output muti-key 
      macros or multiple input combinations to output alternate 
      behavior, or even swap between different configuration 
      profiles to allow more functionality from the same limited 
      inputs on a controller. Outputs may also be mapped to 
      other accessibility-improving functionality, such as a 
      controller-compatible on-screen keyboard or speech-to-text 
      dictation. These features could even boost productivity 
      in professional applications, where a user may desire 
      more shortcuts to enrich and speed up their workflow.

      The Steam Controller's on-screen keyboard allows one to type 
      very effectively with a controller with only two fingers. 
      Predictive text options allow for even quicker typing.

    </table>
    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
      This feature may not only have implications for gaming, 
      but also for greater accessibility in everyday OS operation. 
      Mouse and keyboard use may pose challenges to the differently 
      abled, so a controller, especially a custom one, could be an 
      easier to use, fully functioned primary input device. One 
      might even configure secondary, tertiary, or even more 
      additional input devices to further enhance the efficiency
      and versatility of their Windows use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Handheld gaming devices such as Valve's Steam Deck may also 
      benefit from a Windows controller configurator. Running 
      Windows on such a device would allow wider game compatibility, 
      as well as enable full-fledged computer functionality and 
      synchronicity with other Windows devices.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      Enabling controllers to be used as primary inputs has great 
      implications for accessibility, including the Xbox Adaptive 
      Controller for near infinite customizability, as well as for 
      Windows on handheld devices, such as the Steam deck.

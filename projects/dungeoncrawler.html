    <h2>2D Dungeon Crawler PC Game</h2>
    <h3>Design/Development</h3>
    <p>
      This project was created for a class group project in 2019 
      using Unity. The game is a fantasy medieval themed dungeon 
      crawler with Pokémon-inspired combat. The player must engage 
      in combat, complete quests, and shop for resources to 
      strengthen their team and delve deeper into the procedurally 
      generated dungeons and eventually defeat the final boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      My largest roles on the project were applying and animating 
      art assets and character movement, developing the dungeon map 
      and much of the user interface, and generating the playable 
      dungeon area from my teammate's procedurally generated dungeon 
      data. This data was represented simply as a binary two-
      dimensional array but generating a playable area with seamless 
      dungeon floors and walls from that data was the most technically 
      complex part of my work on the game.
    </p>

      The hub location provides resources for the player, including 
      a shop, a healing fountain, and non-player characters to provide 
      quests, and is connected to the dungeon room in which the doors 
      unlock once the previous dungeon's boss is defeated.
    </p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      When I started my work on creating the playable dungeon area, 
      the programmatic generation of the data for dungeon layouts 
      was nowhere near ready to test with. I took the opportunity 
      to quickly learn a bit of Visual Basic scripting to generate 
      the dungeon layout data I needed from Excel. Essentially, I 
      filled in cells to look like a top-down map of the dungeon 
      and from those cells generated the necessary data to represent 
      the static dungeon floor. Once the procedural generation of 
      that data was complete, I was able to validate the dungeon, 
      its boundaries, and its art was generated properly, even in 
      unique corner cases of strange dungeon layouts I may have 
      missed in the initial static dungeon testing.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      Excel was used to manually create static dungeon 2D arrays from 
      filled cells using Visual Basic.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img class="standaloneImg" src="..\images\dungeon\excel.png" alt="Excel spreadsheet for dungeon data generation"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      This work with the dungeon data helped with the next technical 
      challenge I had in building the map portion of the UI. The 
      map's purpose was to show the explored area of the dungeon 
      in a top-down view and show important landmarks, including 
      the player and the randomly placed stairs to descent down 
      the dungeon floors. The map functions through three main 
      mechanics: translating the game objects' absolute coordinates 
      to relative coordinates, ensuring the map scales properly 
      to fit the map UI screen, regardless of the procedurally 
      generated dungeon's shape, and only displaying the parts of 
      the map which have been visited by the player already.

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="caption">
      The map is updated as the player traverses the dungeon, 
      showing landmarks like the dungeon stairs.

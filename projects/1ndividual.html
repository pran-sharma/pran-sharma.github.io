    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Windows gaming is a massive, ever-expanding space, yet 
      native support for controller configuration and 
      calibration is extremely limited. This project's goal 
      is to allow one to customize the functionality of their 
      controllers through the Windows settings. Desirable, 
      accessible features can be seen in Valve's Steam 
      Controller or Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller 
      but require additional software to configure.
    </p>
    <h3>Potential Features</h3>
    <p>
      Users could remap inputs to output muti-key 
      macros or multiple input combinations to output alternate 
      behavior, or even swap between different configuration 
      profiles to allow more functionality from the same limited 
      inputs on a controller. Outputs may also be mapped to 
      other accessibility-improving functionality, such as a 
      controller-compatible on-screen keyboard or speech-to-text 
      dictation. These features could even boost productivity 
      in professional applications, where a user may desire 
      more shortcuts to enrich and speed up their workflow.
    </p>

      The Steam Controller's on-screen keyboard allows one to 
      type very effectively with a controller, with two cursors 
      controlled by the left and right joystick and activated 
      by the left and right trigger. Predictive text options 
      allow for even quicker typing.

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
      Handheld gaming devices such as Valve's Steam Deck may also 
      benefit from a Windows controller configurator. More 
      widespread game compatibility would be supported by running 
      Windows on such devices, and full-fledged computer use could 
      be enabled as well.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      Enabling controllers to be used as primary inputs has great 
      implications for accessibility, including the Xbox Adaptive 
      Controller for near infinite customizability, as well as for 
      Windows on handheld devices, such as the Steam deck.

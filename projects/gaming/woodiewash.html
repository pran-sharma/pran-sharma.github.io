<h3>Woodie's Road Trip</h3>
<h4>Status: In Development</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    Video game embedded into the Woodie's Wash Shack app. Advertisements can be 
    displayed throughout the game while also allowing users to earn rewards.
</p>
<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    I made a 2D prototype in Godot. I figured creating the game in 3D and styling 
    the game to look 2D would be an easier way to achieve the intended game style.

<h3>2D Dungeon Crawler PC Game</h3>
<h4>Design/Development</h4>
<p>
  This project was created for a class group project in 2019 
  using Unity. The game is a fantasy medieval themed dungeon 
  crawler with Pok√©mon-inspired combat. The player must engage 
  in combat, complete quests, and shop for resources to 
  strengthen their team and delve deeper into the procedurally 
  generated dungeons and eventually defeat the final boss.
</p>

  My largest roles on the project were applying and animating 
  art assets and character movement, developing the dungeon map 
  and much of the user interface, and generating the playable 
  dungeon area from my teammate's procedurally generated dungeon 
  data. This data was represented simply as a binary two-dimensional 
  array but generating a playable area with seamless 
  dungeon floors and walls from that data was the most technically 
  complex part of my work on the game.

  The hub location provides resources for the player, including 
  a shop, a healing fountain, and non-player characters to provide 
  quests, and is connected to the dungeon room in which the doors 
  unlock once the previous dungeon's boss is defeated.

  When I started my work on creating the playable dungeon area, 
  the programmatic generation of the data for dungeon layouts 
  was nowhere near ready to test with. I took the opportunity 
  to quickly learn a bit of Visual Basic scripting to generate 
  the dungeon layout data I needed from Excel. Essentially, I 
  filled in cells to look like a top-down map of the dungeon 
  and from those cells generated the necessary data to represent 
  the static dungeon floor. Once the procedural generation of 
  that data was complete, I was able to validate the dungeon, 
  its boundaries, and its art was generated properly, even in 
  unique corner cases of strange dungeon layouts I may have 
  missed in the initial static dungeon testing.

  filled cells using Visual Basic.

  This work with the dungeon data helped with the next technical 
  challenge I had in building the map portion of the UI. The 
  map's purpose was to show the explored area of the dungeon 
  in a top-down view and show important landmarks, including 
  the player and the randomly placed stairs to descent down 
  the dungeon floors. The map functions through three main 
  mechanics: translating the game objects' absolute coordinates 
  to relative coordinates, ensuring the map scales properly 
  to fit the map UI screen, regardless of the procedurally 
  generated dungeon's shape, and only displaying the parts of 
  the map which have been visited by the player already.

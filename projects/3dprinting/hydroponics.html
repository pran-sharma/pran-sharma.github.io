<h3>Hydroponic System</h3>
<h4>Status: Testing</h4>
<h4>Concept</h4>
<p>
    From my desire to grow hot peppers and the constraints imposed by a small
    space, my hydroponic system was born. A soilless, contained method of growing 
    plants that could be easily serviceable, portable, configurable, and extensible 
    seemed like the most ideal way to begin my horticultural journey.

<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>
    Since a compact setup was the highest priority requirement, I began with a jar 
    and a small, submersible water pump.

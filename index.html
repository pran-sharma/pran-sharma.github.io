        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <section id="about">
          <p>
            I'm a skilled, creative <strong>software engineer</strong> with a nearly lifelong 
            <strong>passion for robotics</strong> and bettering the world. I have experience at 
            <strong>Lockheed Martin</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong>, mostly working 
            in <strong>C++</strong>.

          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I started my robotics journey by forming a LEGO robotics team with my friends 
            in middle school, then went on to lead my high school's robotics team to multiple 
            championships, and ended my academic career with an <strong>intelligent robotic systems 
            minor</strong> (alongside a <strong>math minor</strong> and my 
            <strong>computer science BS</strong>) in my three 
            year <strong>Cum Laude</strong> stint at the University of Central Florida.
            In order to graduate so quickly, I shortsightedly worked hard in school while 
            somewhat disregarding the career prospects which lay ahead. Somehow, the single 
            online job application I sent out landed me at Lockheed Martin, where I worked 
            during my studies for a bit over a year before graduating.
          </p>

            My initial foray into robotics was through LEGO Mindstorms, but I quickly found 
            myself working with bigger and more custom robots.

          <p>
            My time at Lockheed was extremely rewarding and fulfilling. I had the opportunities 
            to work on drones, simulations, sensors, GUIs, and more, allowing me to experience 
            a wide breadth of domains in quite a short period. I found building <strong>drones</strong> and their 
            software to be the most riveting, getting to develop <strong>cutting edge technology</strong> in 
            Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control <strong>Applied Research</strong> division. I got to work with 
            every part of the system, including soldering, calibrating, coding, and testing, 
            both <strong>in the lab and the field</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="caption">
            I earned my degree at the peak of COVID lockdowns and wasn't able to have a 
            proper graduation, so I repurposed my preschool graduation picture.
          </p>
          <img class="mainImg" src="images/decor/grad.jpg" alt="graduation picture">
          <p>
            When my graduation was quickly approaching, I sent out some applications, went 
            through a few interviews, and was captivated by the allure of big tech. I packed 
            up my life into my car and headed away from my partner of over two years to Seattle 
            to work at Microsoft despite only being 
            told I'd be working in operating systems. I ended up working on <strong>Windows WiFi</strong> for 
            almost three years, developing my <strong>technical and soft skills</strong> alike, especially as I'd 
            never really worked as part of a <strong>larger organization</strong> before.
          </p>
          <p class="caption">
            I drove from Orlando to Seattle to work at Microsoft, but my car only made it 
            to Idaho. As you can see, I always stay cool, calm, and collected under pressure.
          </p>
          <img class="mainImg" src="images/decor/carfire.gif" alt="my car exploding during my move to Seattle">
          <p>
            As time passed, the distance from my partner proved to be a greater challenge than 
            my work, so I ended up leaving Microsoft to <strong>move back to Florida</strong>. 
            I took the time off to enjoy traveling with friends and family and totally decompress 
            for the first time in years. When the dust settled, 
            I was faced with my daunting self-imposed unemployment, but also a <strong>shining 
            opportunity</strong> to pursue my goals and my dreams.
          </p>
          <p class="caption">
            On my last day at Microsoft, I made sure to finally get a picture with the iconic sign.
          </p>
          <img class="mainImg" src="images/decor/microsoft.jpg" alt="picture with the microsoft sign on my last day">
          <p>
            I primarily targeted <strong>remote robotics work</strong>, since as the partner of an almost-doctor, 
            I'd have little to no control over our place of residence in the near future. 
            Of course, that did limit the job pool, but I found plenty of viable options, 
            though unfortunately none ultimately found me to be the ideal employee. The months 
            of <strong>solely rejections</strong> were certainly disheartening, but I understood my <strong>lack of 
            direct professional experience</strong> in robotics definitely made me a less attractive 
            candidate.
          </p>
          <p class="caption">
            The free time to travel did somewhat ease the stress of the 
            job hunt. I had the opportunities to rock climb outdoors in 
            Arkansas and visit Europe with my partner, both 
            for the first time!
          </p>
          <table class="images">
            <tr>
              <td><img src="images/decor/arkansas.jpg" alt="rock climbing in Arkansas"></td>
              <td><img src="images/decor/france.jpg" alt="in France with my partner"></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            I finally received a job offer out of the blue, without so much as a proper interview, 
            to work at Microsoft once again, but remotely with a third party contractor. With the 
            chance to work fully remotely, as well as feeling my emergency fund dwindling, I 
            jumped at the opportunity. I find myself back in a fairly <strong>comfortable</strong> position, but 
            I'm still <strong>holding out hope</strong> to find and land my <strong>dream job</strong>.
